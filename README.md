# üß© Employee Management System ‚Äî SOLID Principles in C#

This project demonstrates the **SOLID principles** in object-oriented design using a modular **Employee Management System** implemented in C#. Each SOLID principle is represented by clear and realistic examples following good software design practices.

## ‚úÖ SOLID Principles Breakdown

### 1. üîπ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> *A class should have only one reason to change.*

- `Employee.cs`: defines employee data only.
- `SalaryCalculator.cs`: handles salary calculations.
- `ReportGenerator.cs`: formats employee reports.
- `HRService.cs`: manages employee notifications.

Each class has one focused responsibility.

---

### 2. üî∏ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> *Software should be open for extension, but closed for modification.*

- `EmployeeBase.cs`: abstract base class for all employee types.
- `FullTimeEmployee.cs`, `ContractEmployee.cs`: extend functionality without changing base class.
- New types like `RemoteEmployee` or `PartTimeEmployee` can be added without touching existing logic.

---

### 3. üü™ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> *Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering behavior.*

- `Manager.cs` and `Intern.cs` inherit `EmployeeBase` and can be used interchangeably.
- Their overridden `GetSalary()` methods work seamlessly where `EmployeeBase` is expected.

---

### 4. üü® Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> *Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don‚Äôt use.*

- `IWork.cs`: only contains `Work()`.
- `IManage.cs`: only contains `Manage()`.
- `Developer.cs`: implements only `IWork`.
- `TeamLead.cs`: implements both `IWork` and `IManage`.

This ensures clean and minimal contracts.

---

### 5. üü© Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> *High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.*

- `INotifier.cs`: defines `Notify()` abstraction.
- `EmailNotifier.cs`: implements the interface.
- `HRService.cs`: depends only on `INotifier`, not the concrete implementation.
- Allows easy switching to other notifiers (e.g., SMS, Slack).
